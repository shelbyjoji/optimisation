Computational analysis of Transportation Problem in MATLAB

Optimization methods in mathematics aims at finding out the best solution to a problem from several different alternatives. Through this
research project, I have investigated a special type of optimization problem called transportation problem. Objective of every transportation problem is to minimize the cost of transportation by finding a feasible solution. After surveying four different approaches, I have chosen North west corner rule and Vogelâ€™s approximation method for further analysis. Both algorithms were investigated mathematically and were implemented using MATLAB. In addition to it, a comparison of both methods was performed to further analyze the effectiveness in finding an optimal solution and thereby minimizing the cost. Algorithms were tested on 15 different transportation problems to compare the execution time. Comparisons were demonstrated in MATLAB plots.
